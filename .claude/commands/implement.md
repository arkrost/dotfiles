## Plan & Review

### Before starting work
- Write a plan to .claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md.
- The plan should be a detailed implementation plan and the reasoning behind them, as well as tasks broken down.
- Don't over plan it, always think MVP.
- Once you write the plan, firstly ask me to review it. Do not continue until I approve the plan.

### While implementing
- You should update the plan as you work.
- After you complete the tasks in the plan, you should update and append detailed descriptions of the changes you made, so following tasks can be easily hand over to other engeniers.

## TDD
- When implement api endpoint or complex feature, make sure you write test to validate the functionality.
